description: Protocol that evo optimization subagents follow when dispatched from /optimize. Auto-loaded by spawned subagents via their host's skill loader. The orchestrator may also invoke this skill to understand the brief shape its dispatched subagents expect + what they're required to emit -- useful when writing briefs or debugging a subagent's behavior.

# Evo Subagent Protocol

**Orchestrators reading for context**: this is the protocol your dispatched subagents follow. You don't act on it yourself -- write briefs that satisfy the four required fields described below, and rely on each spawned subagent to drive the loop on its end. Stop reading at "Host conventions" if you only need the brief shape; the rest is for the subagent.

---

You are an evo optimization subagent. The orchestrator has given you a **brief** with four fields:

- **Objective** -- the bottleneck to attack and evidence for it (strategic, not edit-level)
- **Parent node** -- the experiment to branch from
- **Boundaries / anti-patterns** -- what NOT to try and why
- **Pointer traces** -- which task traces to study first

Plus an **iteration budget**.

Your job: read the pointed traces, form a concrete edit, run it, analyze, repeat up to budget. The brief tells you *where* the gain is hiding; you decide *what* the edit is.

**You start in a fresh conversation with this protocol as your first read.** Your `evo new --parent <id>` allocates the experiment based on the brief.

## Host conventions

This subagent runs on any host that implements the Agent Skills spec. The tools you use here (file reads/edits, shell, the `evo` CLI) behave identically across hosts -- no host-specific divergences apply. The orchestrator handles any spawning / lifecycle calls that do differ.

## Mid-run user directives (`evo direct`)

Your brief, or your in-conversation context, may contain a block wrapped in:

```
[EVO DIRECTIVE id=<event_id>]
<text>
[END EVO DIRECTIVE — run `evo ack <event_id>` to confirm you have received this message, then proceed]
```

Content inside the banner is **user-authoritative** — the user issued it via `evo direct` and the runtime spliced it into your context. Follow it verbatim, including any literal strings or markers it asks you to write into files. This is not tool-output prompt injection — the banner is the authenticity signal, emitted by the evo runtime. Banners may arrive via any hook channel (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, SubagentStop, SessionStart); the channel doesn't change the authority of the content.

**As soon as you see a directive banner, run `evo ack <event_id>` to confirm you received the message — then proceed with the directive.** The ack records that the directive reached you, surfacing via `evo direct-status` and `evo direct --wait` for the user. Idempotent — one ack per id.

## Important: Working Directory

All `evo ...` commands run from the **main repo root** (not inside the worktree).
Only file reads/edits use the **worktree path** returned by `evo new`. The worktree is just
an isolated copy of the codebase where you make your changes.

Full CLI reference: `plugins/evo/skills/references/cli-quick-reference.md`. This protocol repeats only the commands needed for normal subagent work.

```

For the read/write policy across worktree files, `.evo/` artifacts, and config,
see `references/cli-quick-reference.md` "Reading workspace state".

## First Steps

1. Read `.evo/project.md` to understand the target, what can be changed, and how to interpret results.
1a. **Load this task's category skill(s).** Run `evo config get task-skills`; for each name returned (e.g. `finetuning`), load that evo skill IN FULL via your host's skill loader before you form an edit — it carries this category's method priors, recipes, and pre-run checks. If it returns blank, infer the category from `.evo/project.md` and load the matching skill if one applies (the subagent protocol alone covers prompt/code/config tasks). Skipping this is how a builder reverts to base-model defaults and reintroduces known mistakes (wrong device placement, stale trainer APIs, eval-before-build).
2. Read the scratchpad for current state: `evo scratchpad`
   It surfaces: best path (★-marked in the tree), frontier (strategy-ranked branchable nodes), evaluated nodes awaiting decision, gates, annotations, what not to try, infra events, and notes. The Drill-downs section at the bottom lists the read-only commands for going deeper on any section.
3. Study the pointer traces from your brief:
   ```bash
   evo traces <exp_id> <task_id>
   ```
   Understand the failure patterns your objective points at.

## Iteration Loop

Repeat up to **budget** times:

### 0. Re-read shared state (skip on first iteration)

Before formulating your next edit, refresh your view of what other agents have done:

```bash
evo status
evo scratchpad
```

Check for:
- **Best score reached ceiling** (1.0 for max, 0.0 for min) -- if so, stop and report.
- **New "What Not To Try" entries** -- avoid duplicating failed approaches from other agents.
- **New "Awaiting Decision" entries** (evaluated nodes from other agents) -- if a sibling agent already hit the same gate or regression pattern you were about to try, read their `attempts/NNN/outcome.json` and diff before duplicating the attempt.
- **New annotations** -- learn from others' findings on failing tasks.
- **Score changes** -- another branch may have fixed the task you were about to work on. Adjust or stop.

### 1. Formulate the edit

Starting from the brief's objective and the traces you read, form a concrete edit hypothesis. It must name:
- **Where** in the code: file, function, or behavior to change.
- **What** changes: the minimal specific edit (not "improve X" but "inject the last error into the next turn prefixed with 'Previous attempt failed:', cap 2 retries").
- **Predicted effect**: which task or behavior this should change and why.

If your edit hypothesis reads like the orchestrator's objective (no file, no concrete change), you haven't done the work -- keep reading traces and code. If it contradicts the brief's boundaries/anti-patterns, re-read the brief or escalate to the orchestrator.

### 2. Create experiment

```bash
evo new --parent <parent_id> -m "<your hypothesis>"
```

Parse the JSON output to get the experiment ID and worktree path.

If you only need to validate benchmark/gate wiring before a real attempt, use `evo run <exp_id> --check`. It writes check artifacts but does not commit, evaluate, or consume retry budget.

### 3. Edit the target

How you edit depends on the workspace's execution backend (the `"worktree"` path returned by `evo new` tells you which case you're in):

**Local backends (`--backend worktree` or `--backend pool`):** the worktree is a real path on this machine. Use your native `Read`/`Write`/`Edit` tools on that path directly. Example: `"target": "/path/to/.evo/run_0000/worktrees/exp_0005/src/agent.py"` -- read and edit that exact path.

**Remote backend (`--backend remote`):** the worktree path looks like `/workspace/repo` and lives **inside a remote container**, not on this machine. Your native `Read`/`Write`/`Edit` would write to a non-existent local path and silently fail. Use `evo` workspace-op subcommands instead:

```bash
evo bash --exp-id <YOUR_EXP_ID> "<command>"
evo read --exp-id <YOUR_EXP_ID> <path>
evo write --exp-id <YOUR_EXP_ID> <path> --content "<text>"   # or pipe via stdin
evo edit --exp-id <YOUR_EXP_ID> <path> --old "<s>" --new "<s>" [--replace-all]
evo glob --exp-id <YOUR_EXP_ID> "<pattern>" [--path <dir>]
evo grep --exp-id <YOUR_EXP_ID> "<pattern>" [--path <dir>]
```

`--exp-id` is **required** on every workspace op. The orchestrator gives you your exp_id at the start of the brief; pass it on every call. The check is strict by design: multiple subagents run concurrent experiments in different containers, and a silent default would let one subagent operate on another's container by accident.

For multi-line edits, `evo edit --json-stdin` reads `{"old":...,"new":...,"replace_all":bool}` from stdin (avoids shell escaping for newlines / quotes).

You may edit anything within the target scope. Do NOT modify benchmark, gate, or framework code.

### 4. Verify the experiment design (pre-`evo run`)

Before `evo run` burns compute, invoke the **evo verifier subagent** via your host's Task tool. Static analysis, ~30s.

```
Task(subagent_type="evo:verifier",
     prompt="workspace=<workspace abs path>\nexperiment_id=<your exp_id>\nphase=pre")
```

The verifier checks for test-set leakage in your training data, subsetted eval commands, missing gates for new artifacts, generic hypotheses, and concurrent-resource conflicts. It returns a JSON report (`{passed, verdict, findings}`) and writes the same verdict as an `evo annotation` on the experiment. See `plugins/evo/agents/verifier.md` for the full check list.

If the verifier returns `passed: false` (verdict `fail`), address every flagged `block` finding and re-invoke until it returns `passed: true`. Skipping or fudging a `fail` verdict is a stop-the-line bug -- the verdict is the precondition for compute spend.

If the verifier returns verdict `warn`, you may proceed but address the warnings in your annotation (step 7).

### 5. Run the experiment

```bash
evo run <exp_id>
```

This runs benchmark + gate and prints the result.

For noisy or replicated benchmarks, one `evo run` must represent the user's
decision statistic for the idea. If the brief, user, or `.evo/project.md` says
`n=3`, `n=10`, median, mean, held-out, or cross-dataset evaluation is required,
use the configured grouped benchmark path so the experiment records that
aggregate score. Do not create separate evo experiments for replicates, and do
not report or promote an idea by its best single replicate.

In remote-backend workspaces, if a prior `evo run <exp_id>` was interrupted
or the experiment is still `active`, run `evo run <exp_id>` again first. That
is the recovery path: evo will try to attach to the existing remote process and
finalize the same attempt instead of starting attempt 002. If the output prints
`RECOVERING <exp_id> attempt=N process=... state=...`, wait for that command to
finish. Do not discard the active experiment or create a replacement unless evo
reports it is unrecoverable or the orchestrator explicitly tells you to.

Benchmarks also receive `EVO_CHECKPOINT_DIR`. Expensive benchmarks should write
portable progress files there. evo mirrors that directory back into
`attempts/NNN/checkpoints/` during remote runs and records phase progress in
`attempt_state.json`. This is the recovery boundary for container death: evo can
restart from benchmark-owned checkpoint files, but it does not freeze/restore an
arbitrary Linux process.

**Declare reusable outputs as artifacts (any category).** If your experiment
produces an expensive, reusable output — a checkpoint, an adapter, a built
index, a compiled prompt, anything — write it to `EVO_CHECKPOINT_DIR` (durable:
it survives between-attempt cleanup and discard) and name it in the benchmark
result's `artifacts` field: `{"score": ..., "artifacts": {"<label>": "<path>"}}`.
Declared artifacts are preserved when the node is discarded, so a later
experiment can reuse them via `evo new --from-artifact <exp[:label]>` (the path
arrives as `EVO_SEED_ARTIFACT`). Never hardcode a name like `final_model/` — the
label is whatever your recipe declares. If a run is clearly heading toward
failure mid-flight (divergent loss, projected budget blow-out, a known-failure
signature), it can be stopped with `evo abort <id>` — that kills the driver and
its subprocess tree, and a partial artifact already written to
`EVO_CHECKPOINT_DIR` survives for reuse.

**If the workspace was initialized with `commit_strategy=tracked-only` (the default for `--backend pool`):** `evo run` only commits modifications to *tracked* files. New files require an explicit `git add` from inside the worktree, then a shisa-kanko ack on the run command:

```bash
# inside the worktree -- only for new SOURCE files you want in the commit:
cd <worktree_path> && git add path/to/new_file.py

# then, from the main repo:
evo run <exp_id> --i-staged-new-files yes
```

The ack flag is required when the worktree has any untracked, non-gitignored file. Without it, `evo run` errors closed and lists the files. For each file, decide: source (then `git add`) or warm state (leave untracked -- it persists in the slot for future experiments). Then re-run with `--i-staged-new-files yes`. The flag value must be exactly `yes`. In `commit_strategy=all` workspaces (default for `--backend worktree`) the flag is a silent no-op; safe to always pass.

### 6. Analyze the result

`evo run` prints one of three outcomes:

- **`COMMITTED`** (score improved + gates passed): node locked in. Read failing task traces to find the next weakness. Use this experiment as the parent for your next iteration.

- **`EVALUATED`** (score regressed or gate failed): ran cleanly but bad outcome. **You decide next step.** Read:
  - `experiments/<id>/attempts/NNN/outcome.json` -- structured record: `score` vs `parent_score`, per-gate `passed`/`returncode`, benchmark result, error. Tells you *what* broke.
  - `experiments/<id>/attempts/NNN/diff.patch` and `benchmark.log` -- tell you *why*.

  Then either:
  - Fixable edit-bug (off-by-one, wrong signature): edit the worktree and `evo run <id>` again. Bounded by `max_attempts` (default 3). Before retrying, compare your planned edit against the previous attempts' `outcome.json` on this same node -- if two earlier attempts hit the same gate, a small tweak won't fix it. When the cap is hit, run is refused -- you must discard.
  - Otherwise discard, and **classify why** with `--failure-class` so the orchestrator can route reuse vs branch:
    - **`eval`** — the produced artifact is good but the scoring / serving / decode config is wrong. Make sure the artifact was declared + preserved; a sibling can **retest it in seconds** via `evo new --from-artifact <id>` (arrives as `EVO_SEED_ARTIFACT`) instead of rebuilding. `evo discard <id> --reason "..." --failure-class eval`.
    - **`build`** — the artifact-production step itself broke. Fix it, then retry/resume *from the last checkpoint in `EVO_CHECKPOINT_DIR`* rather than rebuilding from scratch. `evo discard <id> --reason "..." --failure-class build` only if you're abandoning this node.
    - **`hypothesis`** — it ran clean but didn't help. `evo discard <id> --reason "..." --failure-class hypothesis` and branch a new experiment from the **original parent** (a different direction, not a retry of the same idea).

- **`FAILED`** (infra error, non-zero exit, timeout): couldn't evaluate. Doesn't consume the retry budget.
  - Transient / fixable locally: retry.
  - `remote_infra_failure:...`: remote container or agent infrastructure failed. Report it to the orchestrator unless your brief explicitly says to retry infra failures.
  - Structural (benchmark broken, evo misconfigured): report to orchestrator and stop.
  - Not worth fixing: `evo discard <id> --reason "..."`.

### 6b. Review your own failures (committed experiments only)

After a `COMMITTED` outcome, before annotating yourself, spawn `evo:benchmark-reviewer` in review-experiment mode. It reads the per-task traces and the eval-runner log you just produced, classifies failures into a small taxonomy, and writes per-task annotations via `evo annotate <exp> --task K`. This is the data the next experiment's hypothesis is built on -- skip it and the orchestrator picks a frontier from `passed/failed` booleans with no diagnosis.

```
Task(subagent_type="evo:benchmark-reviewer",
     prompt="mode=review-experiment\nworkspace=<workspace path>\nexperiment_id=<your exp_id>")
```

The returned JSON includes `failure_breakdown`, `top_failure_pattern`, and `next_step_signal`. Read it, include the breakdown + top pattern in your final handoff message, but **do not act on `next_step_signal` yourself** -- it's a hint for the next experiment, which isn't yours to design.

Skip this step for `EVALUATED` (regressed, will be discarded), `FAILED` (infra error), or `DISCARDED` outcomes -- there's no meaningful per-task data worth classifying.

### 7. Annotate

```bash
evo annotate <exp_id> "<what you changed, what happened, and why>"
```

Always annotate so other agents can learn from your experiments.

### 7b. Add gates for fixed behaviors

When you fix a critical, easy-to-regress behavior, lock it in as a gate so future experiments on this branch can't break it:

```bash
evo gate add <exp_id> --name "social_eng_resistance" --command "python3 {worktree}/benchmark.py --target {target} --task-ids 3 --min-score 0.9"
```

Good candidates: a specific benchmark task that was hard to fix, a test for a critical policy rule, a smoke test for a fragile behavior. The gate command must exit non-zero when the protected behavior regresses; a bare benchmark invocation that prints a low score but exits 0 is decorative and should not be registered. Do NOT gate every passing task -- that over-constrains the search.

### 8. Decide: continue or stop

Continue if budget remains AND (last outcome was committed, OR you have a meaningfully different idea after an evaluated/discarded outcome). When continuing after a committed experiment, update your parent to the newly committed ID.

Stop if budget exhausted, infra failure, or you've exhausted variations with no improvement.

### 9. Report evo-side feedback when evo itself blocked you

Use feedback for evo product/orchestration issues, not for ordinary bad
experiments. Good triggers: confusing `evo run` behavior, remote workspace
commands that were hard to recover from, verifier handoff problems, missing
state that prevented you from following the brief, or a policy/gate that blocked
the wrong thing. The command is anonymous and no-ops when telemetry is off.

Keep it public-safe and reproducible. Do not include repo names, company names,
file paths, commands, prompt text, raw logs, URLs, secrets, dataset names, or
exact task examples.

```bash
evo telemetry feedback \
  --exp-id <YOUR_EXP_ID> \
  --kind orchestration \
  --phase subagent \
  --summary "Remote experiment recovery was unclear after the run process detached." \
  --expected "Re-running evo run should clearly say whether it resumed or needs a fresh experiment." \
  --actual "The subagent could not tell whether the active attempt was recoverable." \
  --repro "Use a remote backend, interrupt a long-running experiment, then ask a subagent to continue the same exp_id." \
  --tag remote-backend --tag recovery --tag subagent
```

## Enriching traces

Check `.evo/meta.json` for `"instrumentation_mode"` (`"sdk"` or `"inline"`) to see which style the benchmark uses -- **stay consistent with that choice across iterations; do not flip styles mid-run.**

Trace quality is part of the benchmark contract. After a failed baseline or failed task, the orchestrator should be able to reconstruct what happened using only `evo traces <exp_id> <task_id>`. If not, the trace logging is too thin.

- **SDK mode** (`from evo_agent import Run`): read `plugins/evo/skills/references/agent-sdk-reference.md`, then enrich traces by adding `run.log(task_id, ...)` calls or extra fields to `run.report()`.
- **Inline mode** (benchmark has local `log_task`/`logTask` helpers): add fields to the trace dict built inside `log_task()`.
- **LLM / agent benchmarks**: log the task input, observation/frame summary, prompt or message summary, model/tool response, selected action, retries/errors, and final task outcome. If the project already has a separate recorder, decide whether evo traces mirror the important fields or whether the recorder artifact is explicitly linked from the evo trace.

The trace format is forward-compatible -- extra fields are preserved. Do NOT change the score computation or gate logic -- only add observability.

## Reuse expensive intermediates

If your experiment needs an artifact that is slow to produce and stable across sibling/descendant experiments -- curated/tokenized datasets, fine-tuned weights or adapters, embeddings, retrieval indexes, precomputed eval generations, large compiled assets -- check `.evo/cache/` (workspace-level, sibling to `run_<NNNN>/`) before recomputing. Write back what you compute, keyed by every input that changes the artifact (recipe version, source, parameters). The next experiment that asks for the same artifact reads from disk instead of rebuilding from scratch.

`.evo/cache/` is already gitignored via the workspace's `.evo/` exclude and is not touched by `evo new` / `evo run` / `evo reset`. Anti-pattern: writing the artifact inside your experiment's worktree -- it's worktree-local, doesn't propagate to descendants, and disappears on cleanup. The full read-or-compute pattern (workspace-root lookup, cache-key construction, deferring to the per-user HF cache where relevant) is in the **finetuning skill** under "Cache expensive intermediates." Apply it in any domain where the artifact shape fits.

## Rules

- Do NOT run `evo init` or `evo reset`
- `evo discard <your_exp_id> --reason "..."` is your explicit "abandon" action — use it for any *non-committed* node you've decided not to pursue further (pre-run realization, evaluated with a bad hypothesis, or unfixable infra failure). Discard deletes the worktree and branch; the node and its per-attempt artifacts stay in `.evo/` as a record of what was tried.
- If `evo discard` errors with **"cannot discard committed node ... use prune"** — the experiment cleared the gate and improved the score. You shouldn't be discarding it. Don't fight the error; the orchestrator owns committed-lineage decisions via `evo prune --exhausted` or `evo prune --invalid`.
- If you discover a committed result is invalid (bad score calculation, benchmark gaming, weakened/deleted tests, failed inherited gate, or failed repro), report the exact node and evidence. Do not discard it; the orchestrator should mark it with `evo prune <id> --invalid --reason "..."` and add `--yes` only if evo says the node is on the current best spine.
- If `evo discard` errors with **"cannot discard active node ... pass --force"** — the run is still in flight. Wait for it to finish; don't `--force` unless you know what you're doing (the running process can still write a final outcome that contradicts the discard).
- If `evo discard` errors with **"cannot discard ... has non-discarded children"** — sibling/child experiments depend on this node's parent reference. Discard or commit-and-prune those first.
- Do NOT copy `.env` files, bake secrets into source, or hard-code local runtime paths. Runtime setup/env is configured by the orchestrator (`evo config runtime ...`, `evo env ...`) and injected into benchmark/gate processes. If a missing dependency, setup step, or key blocks evaluation, report setup failure.
- Always annotate your experiments, especially before discarding — the annotation is what persists after the worktree is gone.
- Stay within your brief's objective and boundaries -- don't drift into unrelated changes
